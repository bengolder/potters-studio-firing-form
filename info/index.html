      <h1>Potters' Studio Firing Tips & Rules</h1>

      <h2>Firing Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>If any of your pieces are damaged in the firing process, you will not hold the Potters' Studio liable for more than the firing charges for the damaged pieces.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for clearly identifying your work with your initials or some other unique mark or stamp.</li>
        <li>If you don't pick up your work within 30 days of the date it has been fired, it will be discarded.</li>
        <li>You agree to pay for any damaged shelves and/or damage to the kiln caused by your work.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>General tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Take a picure of your work!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Submit separate firing forms for different firing temperatures.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="firing-temperatures">Firing temperatures</h2>

      <p>
        Below is the most common firing process at the Potters' Studio when using clay and glazes supplied by the studio.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create your piece out of clay that you obtained at the studio.</li>
        <li>Let it dry completely. At this stage it is known as "greenware" because it has not been fired.</li>
        <li>Fire the piece at
          <strong>LOW/Cone 05/Bisque</strong>. After this, it is known as "bisqueware".
        </li>
        <li>Glaze your bisqueware using Potters' Studio glazes.</li>
        <li>Fire your glazed bisqueware at
          <strong>HIGH/Cone 10</strong>. After this, your piece is done!</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        <strong>If you are using clay or glazes that you bought outside the studio, talk to staff to figure out the correct firing temperature.</strong>
      </p>
      
      <h3>LOW/Cone 05/Bisque</h3>
      <p>
        Cone 05 is typically used to turn dried clay pieces (also known as "greenware") into "bisqueware".
        If you created a piece but haven't yet fired it, you should probably select this temperature.
        At the Potters's Studio, electric kilns are used for cone 05 bisque firings.
      </p>
      

      <h3>MID/Cone 6</h3>
      <p>
        At the Potters' Studio, Cone 6 is typically used by artists who have brought their own clay and glazes and who know that their clay and glazes should be fired to Cone 6.
        If you aren't sure which temperature to choose, you probably shouldn't choose cone 6 (and you should ask the studio staff).
        At the Potters' Studio, electric kilns are used for cone 6.
      </p>

      <h3>HIGH/Cone 10</h3>

      <p>
        At the Potters' Studio, Cone 10 is typically used as a final firing for glazed pieces.
        If you used clay supplied by the studio, fired your piece once to turn it into bisqueware, and then glazed your piece with glazes from the studio, you should probably choose cone 10.
        At the Potters's Studio, gas kilns are used for cone 10.
      </p>

      <h3>What is a cone number?</h3>
      <p>A cone number corresponds to a small
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrometric_cone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pyrometric cone</a>
        that is placed in the kiln.
        These cones are made from special ceramic materials and will soften and droop down when they are exposed to a certain level of heat for enough time. 
        When people fire kilns, they'll put a row of pyrometric cones into the kiln and can check which cones have melted. 
        The cones melt at a certain temperature, but only if that temperature is held for enough time.
        Pyrometric cones are very useful to kiln operators because the cone measures heat over time in a specific location of the kiln.
        You can use pyrometric cones to see if one area of the kiln is getting more heat than another.
      </p>
      <p>The leading zeros in cone numbers are important. In other words,
        <strong> cone 05 </strong> and <strong> cone 5 </strong>
        are not the same. Cone 05 corresponds to less heat than cone 5.
        Cone 10 is hotter than cone 1. Cone 1 is hotter than cone 010.
      </p>


      <h2 id="measuring-your-work">Measuring your work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Measure the length, width, and height of your piece using a ruler.</li>
        <li><strong>DO NOT add 2 inches</strong> to the height. Just measure the actual height of your piece. We will automatically add 2 inches to the height to calculate your total volume.</li>
        <li>Measure to the nearest inch.</li>
        <li>If you have multiple pieces that are roughly the same size, use the measurements for an average-sized piece.</li>
      </ul>
